        <h2>Some Things About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Xia Jie (sha), I’ve been fascinated by technology since I was a kid and I want to learn and navigate towards making and contributing to ml/ai projects and hopefully make an impact towards that part of the industry. In my most recent fellowship at Headstarter AI I was inspired by Jack O’Brien’s entrepreneurship and courage to leave Google as a tech lead to pursue his startup his entrepreneurship made me interested in potentially starting my startup in the near future.
            In my free time, I enjoy hiking, working out, and playing tactical FPS games. I enjoy hiking for scenery on top of the mountain working out to make myself feel better and more productive. Last but not least tactical FPS games help keep my brain active and come up with strategic plans in a matter of seconds in a lot of the scenarios and the competing aspect is also really fun. I also like spending time with my friends as I like talking to people who are close to me with similar interests.
            These are some of the projects I built throughout my fellowship.
